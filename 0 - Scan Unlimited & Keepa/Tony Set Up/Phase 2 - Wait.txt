Please write a python script that prints "When Keepa source file is pasted into the directory, type yes: "

The purpose of this script is to wait for confirmation from the user before proceeding

If the user inputs any variation of yes (not case sensitive) then print "Confirmation received. Script complete."

**************************************
# Wait for the user to confirm that the Keepa source file has been pasted into the directory
user_input = input("When Keepa source file is pasted into the directory, type yes: ")

# Check if the user's input is 'yes' (case-insensitive)
if user_input.strip().lower() == "yes":
    print("Confirmation received. Script complete.")
